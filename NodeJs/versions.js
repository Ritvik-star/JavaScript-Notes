// current version of EXPRESS JS = ^4.18.2

// ^4.18.2  = what does that means !

//this version format divides into 3 major parts in npm

//1. Major part (first part)

//      (4) this 4 is a current version and if there will be any big/major change 
        //then they might release 5 as version and if your code is written on 4 version then it will
        //not work properly in 5 version so dont ever update the whole version in your live projects

        //if you are starting from scratch then surely you should be start with latest


//2. Recommended part (.18)

    //this is a 2nd part which we calls as recommended part because in this series npm always 
    //updates the major or most recommended bugs or fixes which they fix in this so always update this part


//3. minor part (.2)
    
    //in this they do update few changes or fixes but they are kind off optional
    //because if you dont update them then even your app will work completely fine.


 
 //     ^ it is a carret symbol which says that this is compatible version
    //means with 4 version other series like .18.2 or .17.1 etc will work.
